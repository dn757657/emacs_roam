#+title: Chemical Composition and Toxicity of Particles Emitted from a Consumer-Level 3D Printer Using Various Materials
#+filetags: :ref:

* Obs
- emits small particulate (ultrafine <1micron)
- emits VOCs

* Params
- high temp means more emmitted particles potentially
- feed rate
- filament type
- color

* Conclusions
- 3D printing emissions are not benign and should be mitigated
- harmful, yes in both cellular level hard through ingesting nano/ultrafine particles annd potential for oxidative particles to harm organns
- nothing pertaining to suggested methods of mitigation
