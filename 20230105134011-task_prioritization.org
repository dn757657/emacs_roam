#+title: task prioritization
#+filetags: :organization:auto:task:

* scratch
- assign time based deadlines? (date & time)
- inherit deadlines from tasks?
- incorporate all other items
- add duration to tasks
- never schedule tasks on scale smaller than day, tasks are scheduled for the day, user figures where to put them in the day

* Automation
** Flow

*** Assign Values
- get deadline and perform days remaining comparison
- effort scale 0-10 assigned by user, read and parse
- read and parse duration argument assigned by user

*** Assign Weights
- deadline most important
- then duration?
- then effort?

*** Minimize

** Values

*** Minimize

**** Deadline
- minimize inverse of difference between scheduled date and deadline date
- what if no deadline assigned? 

**** Total Duration
- ideally the total duration of tasks each day is minimized

**** time spent outside of central desired working window
- or centre times around an ideal time

* Manual

** Flow
- how to handle parent child relationshsips?
- daily review is essential
- indent child tasks vs parents?

*** Rules
- submit new tasks vie wcapture templates as TODO
- review, complete and refile under ready or backlog?

*** Tasks File
- how to structure effectively - one top level task or heading with deadline
  - inherit deadlines form top level task, all tasks under project are indented to indicate parent/child hierarchy

**** Structure
- best is likely very flat
- project as top level heading so we can refile to headings

** Analysis
- analyze daily hours and effort of manually organized items

** Code Workflow
- uptake tasks from tasks file
  - may need to incorporate calendar eventually if importing from shared calendars
- parse each subtree?
- compute scheduled

*** import from tasks
- may need to incorporate calendar eventually if importing from shared calendars

*** parse task trees

**** required params in task
- duration estimation
  - ideal that time to finish analytic is included (switch to active, switch to done?)
- deadline
  - if no time infer midnight
    
*** compute scheduled param
- using parsed tree data trace tree each tree to top (perhaps by level) and assign scheduled

*** how to assign scheduled
- minimize params see above
