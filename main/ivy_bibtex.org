* Issues
- cant open links when linked in org which sucks (org open global)
- ivy bibtex menu does not indicate type or if has notes properly
- doesnt open pdy properly from ivy bibtex menu
- doesnt use ref template/capture template when taking notes - maybe look at system crafters vid?
- no self cite/link to document within ref capture template (would be nice)
- citing in latex docs - really part of latex pipeline projectsc
