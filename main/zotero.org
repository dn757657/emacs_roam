* Notes
- download xpi file and add using package manager within zotaro (add-ons)

* Setup
** better bibtex
- install better bibtex and export to roam home directory
- ensure org roam is pointed to better bibtex .bib file
- set better bibtex within zotaro to export to roam directory
- need mathicn file location and file name for recognition
  
** zotfile
- configure zotfile to dump pdf references in directory within emacs config (.emacs)
- need to set naming convention to match better bibtex cite key so that emacs can find pdf files
- in zotfile preferences (via zotaro)
  - set custom location in 'general settings' as location where references will be accessed via emacs (or you)
  - must be mapped in emacs setup
  - set 'format for all Item Types except Patents' as {%b} to match citekey (this way emacs can find them using ORB or ivy-bibtex not sure)
