#+title: caverna filament
#+filetags: :settings:filament:masc:printing:

* Settings
- nozzle 245
- speed 25mm/s
- 0.2mm layer height
- build plate @ min 80C, 120C recommended
- infill 20%
- exterior walls @ 3 layers (top/bottom/walls)
- scale in z direction?
- ambient 50C - this is noted in the 'specs' section of webpage but not in printing guide? odd
 
* Designs

** Dos
- open infill (aka no top layer)
- gyroid fill
- infill 20%
- create pathways to any isolated interior volumes

** Donts
- thick walls
- closed internal volumes
  
* Notes
- limitation of water access for dissolving soluable components
- ambient requirement noted in webpage but not printing guide?
  
* Questions/Experiments

** Dimensional Accuracy
- try no z scaling or any scaling of any sort 

* Post Process

** dissolve
- recommended 80C agitated water for optimal dissolution speed
- dissolution complete when roughly half original weight (55% mass loss) - how does water mass factor in

** dry
- dry at 60-80C for 8 hours
