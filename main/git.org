* Notes
- git and github are two different things
- three components to git:
  - working directory
  - staged snapshot
  - commit history

    
* Definitions
- remote: server based public github repository
- repository: local collection of version controlled files (typically grouped by project)
- orphaned commit: commit set to be trashed at next cleanup
- head: current tip/snapshot of working branch

* Usage
** Committing 
** Pushing
** Undoing

*** Revert
- undo the changes made by a commit
- can only revert entire repo, no file based commands
- use for undoing changes that have been made public 
- revert to a previous commit
- does not change the commit history, creates a new commit in the branch (linear history progression)
  
*** Reset
- move tip of branch to different commit
- goes back in the commit history, deleting commits beyong the reset
- use for undoing changes that have not been pushed/made public
- creates orphaned commits beyond the commit to which the reset is aimed
- orpahned commits will be deleted in next garbage cleanup
- three types

*** Checkout
- discard changes in the working directory (file checkout)  or inspect previous snapshot of repo (repo checkout)
- checkout a previous commit
- both file and repo level commands
- does not affect commit history/restructure branches
