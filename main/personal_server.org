* How To
- install ubuntu server on system or create VM
- ensure network connection/interface is bridged
- mount any required drives you want to use
- assign static ip
- point port 80 on router to static ip
- point domain to you public ip
- public ip changes, can use some sort of dynamic dns script from afraid.org to update automatically (aternatively than paying for a domain and a static ip)

* Notes
- server is just like a pc where you run different systems on the server such as databases and cloud storage systems, which are like programs
- need to port forward port 80 (http) to access home network from other networks
