#+title: FinModels Source/Asset Paradigm
#+filetags: :paradigm:structure:finmodels:

- present paradigm per 2022/07/09
- basic function may result to maintaining multiple test models and good model as validations, forecasts, etc need to be tested but also do nto want to curate white/blacklists of either when assessing effectiveness of model
- new cashflows paradigm
  - parent object 'component' of asset and flow objects

* Models
- validation pairs as objects
- assets
- forecasts
- eventuallly batch sourceing of similar sources that can support batching to increase spead

** Assets

*** Notes
- x and y columns in data ONLY
- sampling
- can assets be thought of as modfied sources? refined sources? - YES

*** Function
- does not need a forecast, asset forecast is applied independantly of assigned Flows
- Flows assigned to assets to outline inputs and outputs of the asset using known data or forecasted trends

** Component
- parent to Flow and Asset objects

*** Function
- sampling, interpolating, normalization, forecasting  infrastructure

** Flow

*** Notes
- flow objects must be assigned in and out - similar to asset in theroy but not in concept? NO
- only flow objects assigned to an asset will be evaluated by the model in net validations, flow objects can be used to validate other flows/assets whilst not having assigned in/out params, and will be ignored otherwise by model 

*** Function
- increased granularity for asset forecasting
- assigned to an asset in and out
- describes movement of value

** Validation
- pairs of assets or flows
- simple pass fail option
- difference output option
- both option via model validation funcs

** Forecasts
[[id:eda4973e-c4c5-4d47-8bc8-e6cd3a98e428][finmodels_forecasts]]
- forecasts are a property of each asset
- forecast can use multiple sources as indexes?
- standardize pipeline for using various forcasting packages
- standalone object that is configured prior to interacting with other objects
- store in model??
- some sort of capability to assess accuracy/effectiveness of model

*** Sources
[[id:7efe7a45-0384-4eb4-ae99-65aaeac440a5][finmodels_sources]]
- sources of data such as sql, online source, etc
- purely pipelines to deliver information in a range

* Ideas
- could someday integrate with emacs by defining standard capture templates for model components?
