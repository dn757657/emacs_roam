* Validation

** Concept
- validations determine if the model is succeeding per the metrics stored in Validator objects
  
** How
- assets are assigned targets, targets are simply other assets
- assets can be validated individually via the model or the model can be validated by evaluating targets set for each asset assigned to the model

** Dev
- may need to be reconfigured in new source paradigm
- assets should be capable of multiple target assignments?
