* NOTES
- two bolts/studs with wingnuts and diving board style retaining spring in the middle, shorten distance between bolts and tighten washers for adjustable panel mounting, easier to remove panels
- no fasteners on top of panels
- simple ledge or bolt on the bottom of panels to rest on

* Design pros/cons

** pros
- do not need to cut standard 24in x 24in side/floor panels
- retaining spring means easy panel removal by sliding up andm out

** cons
- need to cut and thread one end of each wall and floor support channel component (14 total?)
- trimming of floor panel corners requried

* Components

** Retaining Springs
- print on edge so that filament goes lengthwise for strength

** Corner Braces
- print on 45 face for strength in that direction

* Ideas
- side panels can be chopped up and stacked in slat type formation to add any sort of peripheral
- additional bars can be added in conjunction with panel slatting method?

* To do
- some sort of feet?
- handles for panels?
- filament holder?
