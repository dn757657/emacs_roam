#+filetags: :forecasting:finmodels:

* Dev Notes
- forecasts use sources to project future data
- start with single index forecasts
- progress to multiindex forecasts

** Plan
- try out single and multi index forecasting and then think of how to integrate into model
- method where forecasts are pre configured does not entirely work since training data will be changing but same forecast being applied frequently
- could use some sort of factory? idk
- params that change with usage by different assets must be passed via funcs not init. Is this a solution?

* Usage
- forecasts are preconfigured and fed to model to be used by assets
- doesnt actuallly do the work when initialized to save time, onyl does forecasting/training when called upon
- this way frecast can be configured and initialzied wihtout a ton of time and processing
