* Outline
** outline/info
 - 3D Printing Foam Trauma Attenuating Backings for Ballistic Armor
 - Masters of Applied Science
** Get that foam printing
** Get Foam printing true to form
** Research if foam actually does anything

* Research

** Printing Params
- flow rate
- nozzle temp
- cooling
- environmmental variables (humidity temp press) could all have effects
- material throughput (speed & layerheight)
- bed temp (10mm/s?)

  
** Filamesnt Testing

*** Behaviours to observe/intentional failure 
- head dragging in taller prints and lower layer heights?
