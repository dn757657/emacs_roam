* basics
- subnet addresses are addresses divided wihtin a network 256 per gateway (first three numbers are same)
- gateway is the ip used by local devices to access the outside world (other networks) has to do with router
- your public facing ip changes roughly weekly
- to access outside networks need to forward router port 80 (http) to the static ip of the server (or device you want to access)
- domain can be assigned to your public facing ip, and since the http port points to a specific device, the domain will also point to it
- to ensure server access you need to either
  - get a static IP (paid)
  - or update your domain/subdomain (afraid.org) to point to your pubic facing IP everytime it changes
