* Notes
- Rayan PC likely does the job - could use more RAM if nt NVME drive
- my laptop is ok unless there is significant budget (see pocket 3)
- peripheral budget? procurement?

* PC
** FEM/Sim
*** Needs
- typically CPU heavy
- CPU with ecc mem is preferable, i7 and i5 architectures do not support this
- more cores != better, ideally in the range of 8-12, this applies to hyperthreading
- higher clock speeds favoured over more cores
- NVME drive /drive speed is important
- tissue modelling/body systems
- additive manufaturing elements? packages available

*** Systems
**** Ansys/LS-DYNA - used before 
**** HyperMesh
**** Solidwors/AutoCAD integrated? 

** Modelling
*** Needs
- professional graphics are recommended but often RTX cards perform similar (if not idenitically) and are more accessibel/economical
**** Complex surfaces/curvature
**** 3d scanning perhaps idead - not sure if useful
***** mesh model capbility
- mesh resolving in fusion 360/Autodesk fairly robust, have used

*** Systems
**** Solidworks

**** Inventor

*** Notes
**** balancing available vs new haredware purchase
  - Issues with sim complexity such as Rayan is having, will i have heavier sim work or no? processor issue//bottleneck

* Laptop
** Use own?
- no issues on my
- this grogeous thing: https://droix.net/product/gpd-pocket-3/?attribute_pa_configuration=base-pentium-model&utm_source=Google%2BShopping&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gshopping_CA_CAD&currency=CAD&gclid=CjwKCAjw2rmWBhB4EiwAiJ0mtW7Wwoe_gIw6g2j2P3QuGt_GfjUkqRHlRzEZuk9TtFGe6l57SWcqYhoCqfIQAvD_BwE

* Peripheral
** Notes
- for current desk setup: ~65-70cm
- https://www.esportstales.com/tech-tips/ideal-distance-to-sit-away-from-your-monitor
- 24" ideal for viewing distannce
- LCD/LED doesnt matter
- mount 
- ergo mouse and keyboard - cables? likely dual HDMI/usb ext.
** BoM
*** 24" Monitor x2 27? budget dependant https://www.staples.ca/products/2973621-en-asus-238-ips-frameless-monitor-with-amd-freesync-technology-va24ehey
*** Monitor Mount
- dual monitor
- 50-50cm height for eye height
https://www.staples.ca/products/3018301-en-shoppingall-fully-adjustable-pneumatic-dual-gas-spring-monitor-desk-clamp-mount-black
*** Mouse
-MX 3S or MS650 not much concerned
*** Keyboard
- big fan of wired
  https://www.staples.ca/products/2991918-en-logitech-k845-mechanical-illuminated-keyboard-ttc-blue
*** cords
- usb ext is useful
- HDMI x 2 for monitor hookup depending on GPU inputs
