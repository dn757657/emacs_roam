** How to

*** Assembly
- great place for exploded diagram idenifying components
- lego axel lengths!
  
**** Rotating Assembly
- assemble one flap wheel ot lego shaft
- assemble second flap wheel and ensure both flap wheel holes align by temprarily mating both components
- remove one flap wheel, noting its orientation on the lego axis
- insert large spacer between both flap wheels and replace second flap wheel
- insert individual flaps by exploiting flap compliance, flaps shoudl snap into place with low applied force
- assemble the 11mm spacer outside the flap wheel assembly, followed by the worm folloer gear
- assemble a 1mm spacer on the opposing side of the flap wheel assembly
- to complete the rotating assembly, assemble a 2mm spacer outside the worm follower gear

**** Shell
- assemble the round bevel gear mount and worm gear mounts by pressing into the right shell half
- where are they pressed in!
- assemble the worm, straddled by two 1mm spacers between both worm mounts and peirce with a lego axle
- stack the remaining bevel gear, 1mm spacer, c-bevel mount and handle, ensuring that the c-bevel mount ends curl towards the bevel gear
- peice the stacked components with a lego axle
- press the bevel gear assembly into the holes above and below the round bevel gear mount
- assemble the 4mm spacer and one bevel gear respectively to the worm axle end nearest the bevel gear mount, ensuring bevel gear meshes with other

**** Final
- insert axle end or rotating assembly with worm follower gear into the centre hole in right side shell, careful to mate worm with worm follower gear
- assmeble left shell half to opposing end of rotating assembly shaft
- insert connectors into top and bottom, mating shell halves
- insert top (long) and bottom (short) stops into shell cutouts near top and bottom

** Build Steps
- make small and expandable
- note lego axis fits for each lego compatible component
- define different fits/offsets in one place, concerning lego axle and typical components, to be referenced later in component blurbs

*** Roating Flap Assembly

**** Flaps/Flap Wheels
- fittment in holes
- interactions with other flaps
- flap wheel spacing vs extrusion width
- more flaps, smoother action
- flap number origin (30 LCD with 12 and 6)
- flap layering
- thicknesses, too thick, too thin
- font aspect driving flap shape

**** Spacer
- trailing for flap falling

**** Worm Gear
- 30 teeth, 30 flaps
- clearances iterated to acheive minimal backlash/good feel

*** Drivetrain

**** Worm
- overhang performance, teeth bias, did not affect performance
- some cleanup required
- taller/longer worms failed
- video ref
- loose lego fit for easy sliding
- interated gear instead of worm as printing worm was challenging/did not always succeed

**** Thrust bearings/spacers
- run on smaller surface = reduced friction
- gap is smaller for worm than total length of worm and spacers to limit looseness

**** Bevels
- failed initially due to lack of support outside
- video ref
- sizing minimal to round corner

**** Handle
- simple lego compatible handle
- designed for tight fit

*** Shell
- designed for viewing, adequate regidity and easy assembly

**** Connectors
- shell connectors are a little shorter to keep them from coming out
- tension the rotating assembly eliminating wobble

**** Stops
- initally designed to be adjustable
- measured and installed in shell slots

**** Sides
- sides are fenestrated for easy viewing of assembly/motion
- cutouts for connectors are offset slightly, non-interference fit

**** Bevel holder and nub
- initally did not work as planned with single support
- added small support, interference press fit both components into side

**** Worm Mounts
- reduce complexity of shell sides
- did not want to print rotational interfacing holes vertically due to warping
- press fit/interference fit but still can be disassembled
