how the ufkc do we do this

* COIL
- coil will be submerged in one quarter of rim diameter?
- this means 1.25 mm, which is greater than wire diam = ok
- rim diam is 50mm, coil OD is 7.5 mm
- therefore coil curve diam is 50-2.5-3.75 = 43.75?
- for coil insert add 10 percent for tight fit when 3d pritned mold?

** calc rev count
- one rev is one pitch?
- Larc/revs = pitch, therefore Larc/pitch = revs
- pitch is average pitch!!
